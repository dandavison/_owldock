# Regarding use of Meta.constraints rather than unique=True in the field
# declaration:
# Suppose some POST data has been received by a DRF serializer, and the plan is
# to create Service entries with get_or_create semantics. The DRF serializer
# will fail its validity check if the new Service entries look like they are
# going to try to create duplicates. But only if the unique_contraint is added
# in the Django field definition.
